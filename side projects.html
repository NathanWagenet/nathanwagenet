			<p>Some day, I hope to make my living as a published author. However, that requires a lot of work, a lot of time, and a bit of luck. I'm currently lacking at least the last of those three things.</p>
			<p>So, as a side project, I'm learning how to code and program. This website that you see here was built from scratch by yours truly. I've learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby, and am slowly working my way deeper into a couple of those languages, figuring out more and more of what can be done.</p>
			<p>I'm currently looking for work in these areas. If you need anything done, or know someone who does, and can offer a bit of compensation for it, please contact me at nathanwagenet@gmail.com.</p>
