		<h3>A little about <em>Llyren</em></h3>
		<p>Llyren never wanted to leave his small town in the Llyrellenyan countryside. After all, everyone he knew was there. He had no desire to see the great capital city Rellan, much less to make the two week journey there by foot.</p>
		<p>Finding out that he is one of the Shapers from the old half-believed stories gives him cause to reconsider. Llyren had been content as a healer, but perhaps he was meant for something more, as suggested by the mysterious stranger calling himself Thalloren.</p>
		<p>In the company of three chance acquaintances, Llyren sets off in search of a rumor: the Jewels of Unity, the one chance to save the kingdom.</p>
