			<p><em>Waiting</em> is composed of two sets of poetry that I wrote over the course of a couple years in celebration of both Advent and Lent.</p>
			<p>The Lent poetry is simple, consisting of one sonnet per day, each one finding God in a different part of life.</p>
			<p>The Advent poetry is more complex, being split out into a different theme for each of four weeks, with different symbolic colors and different styles of poetry for each day of each week.</p>

				<strong>The Need and the Promise [Advent: Day 1 of 28]</strong>
				<p><em>"I will put enmity<br>Between you and the woman,<br>And between your seed and her seed;<br>He shall bruise you on the head,<br>And you shall bruise him on the heel." - Genesis 3:15</em></p>
				<p>Long ago, in long-lost Eden, Adam, Eve displayed their greed in<br>Taking fruit from tree forbidden to them by the Lord Most High.<br>Suddenly, their deed discovered, they were found by sin that hovered,<br>Waiting at their door to catch them, drag them down to Hell thereby.<br>There they stood, so full of shame under their Lord's so-loving eye,<br>Knowing now that they must die.</p>
				<p>Now what could they do, so fated? They, now to destruction slated,<br>How could they escape their doom, what freedom could their actions buy?<br>But, the Lord all-loving, caring, came to them, and said, declaring,<br>"One will come, though long-awaited; he'll the knot of sin untie.<br>He will crush the serpent's head, and underneath the darkened sky,<br>He will set right what's awry."</p>

				<strong>Our Hope Has Come [Advent: Day 10 of 28]</strong>
				<p><em>"Now, Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in peace,<br>According to Your word;<br>For my eyes have seen Your salvation,<br>Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br>A light of revelation to the Gentiles,<br>And the glory of your people Israel." - Luke 2:29-32</em></p>
				<p>The Promised One, Messiah, comes to earth.<br>And now, O Lord, I see your great salvation:<br>A child, a baby boy, whose virgin birth<br>Can bring the light of God to every nation.<br>O Lord, I hope in you, for you are Hope;<br>And now I may depart from here in peace,<br>For Christ will clear my sin: I cannot cope,<br>But Christ will take my sin; may He increase.<br>Salvation comes, not just to Israel,<br>But over all the world: Christ reigns on high.<br>Salvation comes; I bid my sin farewell.<br>O, I am saved! No longer will I die.<br>For Christ is light to Gentile as to Jew;<br>O, glory! did you know? He died for you.</p>

				<strong>O Oriens [Advent: Day 27 of 28]</strong>
				<p><em>O Morning Star,<br>splendor of light eternal and sun of righteousness:<br>Come and enlighten those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.</em></p>
				<p>Arise and shine, O Holy Light,<br>And come to those who live in night!<br>Arise, and with your healing wings<br>Bring life to fallen, mortal things:<br>Lift up the sun, and make all bright.</p>
				<p>O splendor of eternal light,<br>Thy glory comes on us in might;<br>The prophet's voice through ages rings:<br>Arise and shine.</p>
				<p>Thou Morning Star, Who puts to flight<br>The darkness, and sets all to right,<br>Send forth that star which guideth kings!<br>Those three to Bethlehem it brings<br>That they, like prophet, may then write:<br>Arise and shine!</p>
				<p>[Green/O Antiphon]</p>

				<strong>Day 15</strong>
				<p>I looked for God, and found Him in the smell<br>Of flowers, smell of earth, and smell of rain:<br>That petrichor which permeates my cell<br>Of drywall, stucco, stone, and windowpane.<br>You find Your way into my sheltered life<br>And wake me up with sharp and fragrant scents,<br>For You're the sweetest smell amid the strife<br>On earth, where fallen man doth pitch his tents.<br>Now fifteen days of Lent have passed me by<br>And You have woken me to life from death.<br>Thy incense filled my nostril, stung my eye;<br>Thy Spirit has restored my failing breath.<br>In smells of earth I found You; take me higher,<br>To fragrances of heaven, to holy fire.</p>

				<strong>Day 22</strong>
				<p>I looked for God, and found Him in depression,<br>When nothing shines with life and all is gray;<br>When life is filled with emptiness, oppression,<br>I know You're near in all I do and say.<br>I know You're near, and yet, You seem so far,<br>So far from what I need but never have;<br>Come fill my life with You, my guiding star,<br>And heal my wounds with Thy all-healing salve.<br>On this, the twenty-second day of Lent,<br>I ask, O Father, can You really heal?<br>For now, my strength is fading, nearly spent.<br>O, help me, God; the pain's too much to feel.<br>I trust You, Lord; do not forsake me now,<br>But lift me up from lonely pain, somehow.</p>

				<strong>Day 39</strong>
				<p>I looked for God, and found Him on the cross,<br>His tortured, naked body hanging there<br>Between the thieves, and suffering such loss;<br>I cannot comprehend such huge despair.<br>O Lord, You willingly have suffered all<br>That I, the guilty one, might now be free.<br>Your blood runs down, as over hangs a pall:<br>The black earth quakes, the whole world mourns for Thee.<br>Just one more day of waiting, O my God!<br>How long must this go on? Time seems to halt—<br>As pain is poured out, saving sinners flawed,<br>Christ hangs there, lifted up: Thee we exalt.<br>My God is hanging on a cross—what wonder!<br>How can this be? My world is torn asunder.</p>
