		<h3>A little about <em>Elraen</em></h3>
		<p>The four Shapers are reunited and in possession of two of the three Jewels of Unity, but how to find the Ruby Ring? The homeland of the Lirenda sank beneath the waves of the Western Seas thousands of years before, and no one knows where the Temple of Fire might be.</p>
		<p>Elraen figures that, since the Lirenda have been living on Llyrellenya with the Addyri ever since, there must be clues to be found back where they started: the city of Rellan. They try to return despite the danger of the Nira, but are quickly diverted and sent off on a voyage to the very place that they had thought lost to their reach forever.</p>
		<p>There is little left above the surface, but the Shapers delve into the ruins of the ancient Lirendan cities to find a greater danger than any they have yet encountered, festering among the bones of the dead.</p>
